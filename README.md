This is an animated [Glider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_%28Conway%27s_Life%29) in SVG.

## Configuring the animation

The animation supports a view parameters (via entities) to configure the details:
* scale (determines the overall size)
* color
* radius of the dots
* animation duration
* frequency of the turbulence noise in the background

P.S.:
This doesn't mean that I think everybody should accept the Glider as the hacker emblem.
Do what you want.
I just thought it's nice to animate this in SVG.
